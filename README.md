What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	My favorite assignment was assignment 3. I greatly enjoyed building front end servers. It was so intresting to take a real world task- building a lift like app, and see it come to fruition. This assignment was truly the culmination of all the front end development knowledge I accumulated over comp20. 
How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	I feel as if I have grown alot. Really, my knowledge of modern computing has shaped itself. From day 1, I was very unfcomfortable building front-end on my own, but now, I am truly enjoy working with this kind of full-stack mindset. 
What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	-I had never implemented third party apis. This was super amazing to learn how to do efficently and properly. 
	-I had 0 knowledge of how backend servers workedc before this class. I was very excited to write a program that would allow me to explore database functionality.
Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	-I want to explore how we interact with the web from a design perspective. I think there is alot of backend and front-end design changes that will happen in my lifetime. This, due to the growing importance of mobile computing, seems like an amazing topic to explore more.
