Come gather round, children,
It's high time ye learned
'Bout a hero named Homer
And a devil named Burns.
We'll march 'till we drop 
The girls and the fellas.
We'll fight 'till the death 
Or else fold like umbrellas.
So we'll march day and night
By the big cooling tower.
They have the plant
But we have the power.
Now do "Classical Gas!"
So we'll march day and night
By the big cooling tower.
They have the plant
But we have the power.
